# A-STEPdee

## Purpose

The A-STEP DEE transforms simulated interactions into a form resembling the output of the
detectors. These simulations should be made with MEGAlib Cosima using the geometry in 
AstroPix/A-STEPsimulation, specifically a geometry in which the rocket is aligned along
+z, the detector stack is separated along +y, and the origin is the center of the inner-
most detector.
